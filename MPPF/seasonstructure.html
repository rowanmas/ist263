    <h3>Structure:</h3>
    <p>45 game season: each player will play each opponent in one best-of-5 series. 25 of these games will occur before the Spring break, 20 after spring break. <br> This will be followed by the MPPF post-season.<br> If a player completes their first 25 games of the season and would like to continue playing, they may do so with <strong>leisure games</strong>. <br> These games are friendly and do not affect the season record of players.</p>
