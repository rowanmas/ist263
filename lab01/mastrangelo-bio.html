    <body>
        Im Rowan Mastrangelo, a first-year at SU. I am currently enrolled as a dual-major: Broadcast Journalism & Data Analytics. I would love to call sports or use my voice in any fashion for the broadcast sector of my major. For data, walking businesses through complex data and providing insight on what the data means would be enjoyable. I have been singing for five years and specifically enjoy singing opera. I have also played basketball for 8 years, have two siblings, and enjoy the legal drama Suits. Excited to get to work!
