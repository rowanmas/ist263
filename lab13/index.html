            I'm Rowan Mastrangelo, a first-year at SU. I am currently enrolled as a dual-major: Broadcast Journalism & Data Analytics. I would love to call sports or use my voice in any fashion for the broadcast sector of my major. For data, walking businesses through complex data and providing insight on what the data means and how we should <strong>approach</strong> it would be enjoyable.

            I have no prior coding experience, however, this has always been something I am interested in. Excited to get to work!
